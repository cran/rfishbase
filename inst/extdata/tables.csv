countref,"The COUNTREF table holds country-specific information such as the official names in English, French and Spanish, the UN statistical name and code number, name and coordinates of the capital city, FAO areas, aquaculture production, shelf area, languages, international bodies and legal instruments, etc.",http://www.fishbase.org/manual/english/fishbasethe_countref_table.htm
country,"Country governments are the political bodies that deal with fisheries management, research and conservation at the national level. It is therefore important to know all the countries where a species occurs, and vice-versa. As mentioned above, the distributional range of many species is not well established. Country-specific checklists of fishes prepared by non-taxonomists often contain misidentifications and generally cannot be verified; on the other hand, complete checklists published by taxonomists and based on verifiable specimen collections do not exist for many countries.",http://www.fishbase.org/manual/english/fishbasethe_countries_table.htm
diet,"Knowledge of the diet composition of a fish species at a specific locality is useful in assessing its ecological function and impact, for the construction of ecosystem models (see Box 21), and to help define the nutritional requirements of potential aquaculture species. In FishBase, data in the DIET table are also used to estimate the trophic level of species",http://www.fishbase.org/manual/english/fishbasethe_diet_table.htm
ecology,"The head section of this table, defining habitats, is straightforward, and consists mainly of yes/no choice fields indicating the environmental preferences of a species. The categorical breakdown of possible habitats summarizes the otherwise lengthy text descriptions for species found in different types of environment, and makes such descriptive data accessible to rigorous queries.

faoareas,"The FAOAREAS table lists all the FAO statistical areas in which a species occurs, and vice-versa. A choice field classifies such occurrence into: native; endemic (i.e., naturally occurring in no other FAO area); introduced; extirpated (i.e., extinct in this area but still existing in other FAO areas); reintroduced (i.e., after extirpation); unclear. Note that strains and artificial hybrids are always classified as introduced, even if the strain originates from the FAO area in question, because hybrids and strains are by definition genetically distinct from wild populations. ",http://www.fishbase.org/manual/english/fishbasethe_faoareas_table.htm
faoarref,"The FAOAREAS REF table contains the names of the 27 statistical areas as defined by FAO, together with some notes on these, based on data from the World Resources Institute (WRI 1990, 1996). These include the length of the Coastline, the estimated Shelf area to 200 m depth, and the area of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) [not presently shown in user version]. Note, however, that coastline length has a fractal dimension and thus should not be used in comparative studies unless measured with the same 'stick length'. WRI is working on such standardized coastline lengths, and we will use these as soon as they become available. ",http://www.fishbase.org/manual/english/fishbasethe_faoareas_ref_table.htm

morphdat,"The MORPHOLOGY table incorporates descriptive characters in multiple choice fields and morphometric and meristic characters in numeric fields. It is mainly the meristic characters that are used for quick identification, following the database identification scheme of Froese and Papasissi (1990). The structure of the MORPHOLOGY table and the choice of fields it includes are based on a close study of major texts in ichthyology (e.g., Lagler et al. 1977) and consultation with numerous colleagues. Some of the terms employed in the table are highly specialized; their definition may be found in the FishBase Glossary. ",http://www.fishbase.org/manual/english/fishbasethe_morphology_table.htm

oxygen,"The OXYGEN table documents the oxygen consumption of fishes based on experiments reported in the published literature, together with factors known or likely to affect metabolic rate, notably body weight, temperature, salinity, oxygen concentrations, activity level, swimming speed and stress. Additional experimental details, such as the number of fish, and other information may be in the Comment field",http://www.fishbase.org/manual/English/PDF/FB_Book_ATorres_Oxygen_11Jul11.pdf
popchar,"This table presents information on maximum length (Lmax ), weight (Wmax) and age (tmax) from various localities where a species occurs. The largest values from this table are also entered in the SPECIES table. The POPCHAR table also indicates whether the Lmax, Wmax and tmax values or various combinations thereof refer to the same individual fish. ",http://www.fishbase.org/manual/english/fishbasethe_popchar_table.htm
popgrowth,"This table contains information on growth, natural mortality and length at first maturity, which serve as inputs to many fish stock assessment models. The data can also be used to generate empirical relationships between growth parameters or natural mortality estimates, and their correlates (e.g., body shape, temperature, etc.), a line of research that is useful both for stock assessment and for increasing understanding of the evolution of life-history strategies",http://www.fishbase.org/manual/english/fishbasethe_popgrowth_table.htm
poplf,"Length-frequency data are widely used to derive growth estimates, especially in small tropical fishes (see the POPGROWTH table, this vol.). Froese and Binohlan (2000) have shown that length-frequency curves can also be used to get a first assessment of the status of a stock  if the data are plotted in a framework of asymptotic length, length at optimum yield, and length at first maturity (see Key Facts, this vol.). With this new table, we try to collect and preserve historical data from unfished or still lightly fished populations, to be contrasted with the curves typically produced from overexploited stocks, where the large, highly fecund fish (the Mega-spawners) have disappeared and the bulk of the catch is made up of juveniles which had no chance to reproduce. ",http://www.fishbase.org/manual/english/lengthfrequency.htm
popll,"This table contains relationships for the conversion of one length type to another for over 8,000 species of fish, derived from different publications, e.g. Moutopoulos and Stergiou (2002) and Gaygusuz et al (2006), or from fish pictures, e.g. Collette and Nauen (1983), Compagno (1984) and Randall (1997)",http://www.fishbase.org/manual/english/PDF/FB_Book_CBinohlan_Length-Length_RF_JG.pdf

poplw," Length-weight relationships are important in fisheries science, notably to raise length-frequency samples to total catch, or to estimate biomass from underwater length observations. The LENGTH-WEIGHT table presents the a and b values of over 5,000 length-weight relationships of the form W = a x Lb, pertaining to about over 2,000 fish species.  The units of length and weight in FishBase are centimeter and gram, respectively.",http://www.fishbase.org/manual/english/fishbasethe_length_weight_table.htm

Descriptions of the life cycle, and of the mating and spawning behavior are also presented in this table.",http://www.fishbase.org/manual/english/fishbasethe_reproduction_table.htm
species,"The SPECIES table is the backbone of FishBase, and has the scientific name as its basic unit. Every bit of information in FishBase is attached directly or indirectly to at least one species and it is mostly through this table that information is accessed. The SPECIES table covers all of the estimated 25,000 extant fishes.",http://www.fishbase.org/manual/english/fishbasethe_species_table.htm

stocks,"Fisheries scientists work with the exploited part of populations which they term 'stocks'. Similarly, aquaculturists work with 'strains', i.e., races or varieties of a certain species.

synonyms,"When we developed the FishBase concept, back in 1988, we had the notion that fish taxonomy was in a reasonably good state, that most names used in the literature would be correct, and that the rest could be dealt with through synonymies. While these assumptions were largely true, we dreadfully underestimated the remaining difficulties such as inconsistencies in recent publications, the necessity to keep track of and completely understand taxonomic works, and the sometimes detective-like work needed to assign a piece of information to the proper biological species.",http://www.fishbase.org/manual/english/fishbasethe_synonyms_table.htm
