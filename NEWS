Versioning
----------

Releases will be numbered with the following semantic versioning format:

<major>.<minor>.<patch>

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor 
  and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor 
  (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
* Following the RStudio convention, a .99 is appended after the patch
  number to indicate the development version on Github.  Any version
  Coming from Github will now use the .99 extension, which will never
  appear in a version number for the package on CRAN.

v2.1.0
------

* improve sealifebase operations
* Updates for optimized version of fishbaseapi
* More stable tests

v2.0.3
------

* Use `dontrun` instead of `\donttest` in the documentation.  Apparently CRAN has decided to run donttest blocks in the examples, which can fail on their test servers when transferring data files over a network connection (which is why they were marked `donttest` in the first place.)

v2.0.2
------

* bugfix for package unit tests on some platforms

v2.0.1
------

First official release of the new rfishbase package, a non-backwards
compatible replacement to all earlier versions of FishBase. See the
package vignette for a more detailed overview and introduction.
